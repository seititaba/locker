# Project Locker

A locker is the name of a system that is used to control water flow. For lack of better naming, it will be used as a alias to "eclusa" (portuguese). The locker will control personal flow in and out from our shop.

At first, we will develope ours system using an Arduino UNO for prototyping. For future work, it will be developed a Raspberry PI version, that will be the first release.


## Getting Started

To get a copy of locker repository and contribute to this project, use:

* For HTTPS:
```
git clone https://github.com/seititaba/locker.git
